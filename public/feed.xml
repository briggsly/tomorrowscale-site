        <title>The Mind's API - Rune Labs</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/tomorrowscale/embed/episodes/The-Minds-API---Rune-Labs-e100kf4&quot; height=&quot;160px&quot; width=&quot;800px&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this episode we’ll take a walk, literally, with the founder and CEO of Rune Labs, Brian Pepin. Brian previously led electroceuticals development at GSK-backed Galvani, built a glucose-sensing contact lens at Verily, paid dues at Google X Labs, and built brain-computer interfaces at Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discuss how Brian and his team at Rune Labs are trying to become the full-stack source, or the fabric, for neuroscience research. Their platform connects patient brain data to clinicians and researchers to help discover and develop novel diagnostics, devices, and even treatments for patients with various neurological disorder..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: When we caught up with our guest, he was on the move so forgive a bit of background and mic noise.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Virtual Recovery - Prof John Krakauer</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/tomorrowscale/embed/episodes/Virtual-Recovery---John-Krakauer-etrbt7&quot; height=&quot;160px&quot; width=&quot;800px&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In flash, a stroke can have devastating consequences. Improving recovery outcomes will require new thinking. My grandmother’s stroke years ago shook my family. I saw her in fits over the loss of precious skills—-the simple joy of typing, gone. The road to recovery is difficult, but the future of rehabilitation is bright and interactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this episode we’ll speak with Dr. Jon Krakauer, neurologist, director of the Brain Learning and Movement Lab and professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University, and Chief Medical and Scientific Advisor to MindMaze, a company developing such telerehabilitation and digital therapeutics for neurologic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Krakauer is a scientist and entrepreneur at the forefront of virtual recovery research. He is the head of one of the most multidisciplinary laboratories you’ll come across (the BLAM Lab at Johns Hopkins) in which his team conducts foundational neuroscience research. He and his team have developed digital medicines for stroke rehabilitation and other applications. And he is not afraid to challenge conventional approaches or thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers and entrepreneurs like Dr. Krakauer are building entire virtual worlds to help patients navigate recovery more interactively and effectively. A new wave of digital therapeutics leveraging software, devices, even robotics to deliver novel experiences to patients is coming online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandmother never fully regained the ability to type. The work of Dr. Krakauer, collaborators, and other scientists working on this new type of digital neuropharmacology could potentially engage more of the brain to drive better outcomes for patients in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtual recovery is here, and this medicine cabinet is in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are stories from the cutting edge of science and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Breaking the Synthesis Barrier - Postera</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/tomorrowscale/embed/episodes/Breaking-the-Synthesis-Barrier---PostEra-eklh4i&quot; height=&quot;102px&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you make a molecule? We’ve talked before on the TomorrowScale podcast about the challenges facing chemists–the “synthesis barrier.” The creation of novel materials and the discovery of small molecule drugs is a labor-intensive, iterative process. Exploring new chemical space requires chemistry know-how, ingenuity, and brute force experimentation. It was thought that the chemical space is too vast, and the problem too multifactorial for machine learning to make much headway to unlock nature’s recipe book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And then, suddenly, it wasn’t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PostEra uses machine learning to power a Chemistry-as-a-Service offering that hopes to accelerate drug discovery.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this episode we’ll meet Dr. Alpha Lee, Chief Scientific Officer, and Aaron Martin, CEO, two of three founders of PostEra.  We discuss their work developing novel machine learning models that have demonstrated significant step-change improvements in the state of the art on chemistry-related and binding prediction data science tasks. Dr. Lee’s research, starting from his lab at the University of Cambridge, includes a model that “speaks chemistry” [1], a graph neural network model that handles uncertainty in low data environments [2], and another that leverages the statistics of random matrices to tease the signal from the noise [3].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the future of chemistry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We are in a position similar to that of a man who was provided with a bunch of keys and who, having to open several doors in succession, always hit on the right key on the first or second trial. He became skeptical concerning the uniqueness of the coordination between keys and doors.”&lt;/strong&gt; - Eugene Wigner, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1002/cpa.3160130102&quot;&gt;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences&lt;/a&gt;” (1960)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Last Interface - Paradromics</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/tomorrowscale/embed/episodes/The-Last-Interface---Paradromics-ei30hv&quot; height=&quot;160px&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of brain-machine or brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) approaches an inflection point; not just in the pace of BCI progress, but also the capabilities and willingness to explore the field of neurotechnology have accelerated dramatically in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 … 100 … 3,072 … 65,536 …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this episode of the TomorrowScale podcast, we speak with the scientist and entrepreneur leading a startup developing implantable connections between our brains and computers. Our guest is Dr. Matt Angle, CEO of Austin, TX based Paradromics. He and his team just announced the ARGO system: a brain computer interface consisting of an implantable microwire electrode array with over 10,000 channels per square centimeter. At 26 Gigabits per second they have demonstrated the largest ever electrical recording of cortical activity in preclinical studies. At 65,536 parallel electrode channels, Paradromics has opened the largest window into the senses and doorway into the brain to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our conversation, we discuss the science of brain computer interface technology and look toward the potential clinical and consumer applications for melding humans and machines. Also, Matt candidly addresses the balance between the hype and hurdles that facing Paradromics and the neurotechnology field at large: Everything from the immense engineering and computation challenges, to the systemic issues holding back hard tech commercialization, a neurotechnology competitive playing field that now includes billionaire pet projects, and what it was like moving their company out of Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On-Demand Biology - Tierra Biosciences</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/tomorrowscale/embed/episodes/On-Demand-Biology---Tierra-Biosciences-efv774&quot; height=&quot;160px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you build biology? Simple: DNA to RNA to proteins, right? Not so fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each one of your trillions of cells are themselves little factories, constantly producing various peptides and proteins that your body needs from building blocks of amino acids encoded by our genes. Multiple industries use various forms of biological manufacturing wherein they’ve harnessed cells of some kind–yeast, &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, animal, and human cell lines–to manufacture proteins for us. But there are downsides to traditional cell culture methods: those same cells that protect also constrain. And some scientists want to leave the cell behind entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this episode, we’ll discuss the potential of cell-free manufacturing–“bits to biology”–with Tierra Biosciences CEO Zachary Sun, PhD. Zach co-founded Tierra with leading synthetic biologists in Harvard’s George Church and CalTech’s Richard Murray. Their vision is to “break free of the cell and fundamentally change how scientists approach discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched just last month, Sol by Tierra is a cell-free manufacturing system that serves as a biological synthesis-as-a-service layer for R&amp;amp;D scientists. And it could play a key role enabling an on-demand biological future, where the protein of interest is just a click away.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Nature's Nuclear - Oklo, Inc.</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/tomorrowscale/embed/episodes/Natures-Nuclear---Oklo-Inc-efad3j&quot; height=&quot;160px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this episode Oklo co-founders Jacob DeWitte and Caroline Cochran join us to discuss what it took to get their startup to this point in development of the first advanced nuclear fission power plant; how a chance meeting with Sam Altman (OpenAI, YCombinator) changed their path; and how to think big, by starting small, even in nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year Oklo became the first company to submit a combined construction and operating license application to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (or NRC) for what is called an “advanced fission power plant.” Their design, the Aurora “powerhouse” centers around the concept not of a traditional reactor, but of a small, modular fission battery hundreds of times smaller than traditional reactors. Listen as Jake and Caroline take us through the fascinating founding story of Oklo and their big vision for the small future of clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trials to Your Door - Sanguine Biosciences</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/tomorrowscale/embed/episodes/Trials-to-Your-Door---Sanguine-Biosciences-eenbh9&quot; height=&quot;160px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the center of every clinical trial is a group of patients, each with a medical condition that we seek to understand more about through interacting with those patients directly. Startups like Sanguine Biosciences are part of a clinical services innovation layer, connecting population health, clinical research, and healthcare delivery in new ways using new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this episode, our guest is Brian Neman, CEO of Sanguine Biosciences, and adjunct instructor at the University of Southern California’s Price School of Public Policy. We discuss how recent technological advancements enable new ways of making clinical research that improves safety, efficacy, and efficiency, and—-critically in the time of COVID-19–improved continuity of care and medical research.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Your Digital Twin - UnlearnAI</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/tomorrowscale/embed/episodes/Your-Digital-Twin---UnlearnAI-ee0le3&quot; height=&quot;160px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this episode we’ll meet biophysicist, machine learning researcher, and CEO of UnlearnAI Dr. Charles Fisher. He and the team at Unlearn have the goal to build the entire biomedical machine learning stack, from scratch. Their strategy is that with a fit-for-purpose biomedical machine learning infrastructure and novel deep learning techniques, along with enough data about patients, that they can generate synthetic versions of actual patients, entirely in the data, with the goal to make them “computationally indistinguishable” from real patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A “digital twin” could help to better understand the impact of medicines before they’re used in a real patient, or in clinical trials to be used alongside real patients in what they call “intelligent control arms.” Unlearn believes that we can obtain the same rigorous, statistically-powered clinical evidence but with fewer subjects. A fascinating approach to the problem of how to make clinical trials more efficient, and understand more about what may be possible with more and better patient data.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Measure of Medicine - Prof Frank Lichtenberg</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/tomorrowscale/embed/episodes/Proof-of-Prophylaxis---MIT-Langer-Lab---Drs--Ana-Jaklenec--Kevin-McHugh-e9vbp1&quot; height=&quot;160px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this show we talk a lot about the opportunity and the promise of innovation. It is incredibly difficult, however, to study the actual impact of those new technologies. In healthcare, we do have some chance to measure the impact of new medicines. But! What data do we use? What metrics are used? and why are they used? Today’s guest is Dr. Frank Lichtenberg, the Courtney C. Brown Professor of Business at the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University. Dr. Lichtenberg has taught at Columbia, Harvard, and Penn, worked for the Department of Justice, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Census Bureau, and has conducted several large studies on the impact of pharmaceutical innovation across diseases and geographies over the last 25 years. Right now, billions are sheltering in place from a pathogen that we must fight with drugs and vaccines. The purpose of this conversation is to gain a little bit better understanding of an important topic, relayed in the voice of a leading researcher, so that we may, in the future, invent and develop safer, better technologies to fight disease. To do that, we must measure medicine’s impact not only on the patient, but also the patient population, the healthcare system, and the entire economy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Computing the Universe - Jonathan Gorard, Wolfram Physics Project</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/tomorrowscale/embed/episodes/Computing-the-Universe---Jonathan-Gorard--Wolfram-Physics-edcssn&quot; height=&quot;160px&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this episode, we’ll speak with one of the principal researchers on the Wolfram Physics Project, Jonathan Gorard. We’ll discuss how they plan to actually implement their “fundamental theory of the universe” and build these computational universes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Gorard is a theoretical mathematician, researcher at the University of Cambridge, and consultant to Wolfram Research. He is ostensibly the scientist tasked with doing the maths to demonstrate these concepts to the scientific community and the public. Actually proving these ideas out in the open, over the din of more than a few detractors, may be one of the most difficult parts of this highly complex project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with a call for scientists everywhere to contribute and critique the project in an open-source manner, the team published nearly a thousand pages and over 500 hours of video. All since Wolfram’s announcement on April 14th titled, “We may have found a fundamental theory of the universe… and it’s beautiful.” The Wolfram Physics team, consisting of Stephen Wolfram, Jonathan Gorard, and theoretical physicist and competitive programmer Max Piskanov, are literally live-streaming the entire thing. Scientific discovery, open collaboration, and peer review happening in real-time, and anyone can get involved. Now that is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the TomorrowScale Podcast. Hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/briggsly&quot;&gt;Justin Briggs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
