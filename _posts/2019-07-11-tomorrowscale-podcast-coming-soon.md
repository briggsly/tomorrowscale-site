**The TomorrowScale Podcast is a series of conversations with the scientists and leaders who are building the future.**

I am very excited to announce that we are in production on the first episodes of the TomorrowScale Podcast! We will explore cutting edge technologies with huge potential, and go deep to understand how these founders and inventors must chart entirely new territory to bring their technology to market. On the TomorrowScale Podcast, we have discussions on a wide range of scientific frontiers, from life sciences to AI, nanotech and materials, to medicine and the very food we eat. Our goal is to encourage others who work in or support scientific research and the commercialization of new technologies. We'll chart the landscape of what's coming next and the implications. We'll learn - quite literally - how science *fiction* becomes *reality* in research & development labs at companies, universities, and non-profit institutions around the world.

First episodes recording now.

Stay tuned for new episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, SoundCloud, Anchor, Stitcher, and Overcast.
