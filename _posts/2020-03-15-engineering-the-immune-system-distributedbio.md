On this episode we sit down with star scientists from Netflix's show 'Pandemic,' DistributedBio co-founder and CEO Jacob Glanville, and Centivax program lead and director of contract research Sarah Ives. Weâ€™ll hear more about the company's founding story, get perspective on bootstrapping a biotech company, and learn more about their internal and client development programs that cover everything from vaccines, antibodies, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, and which target diseases as varied as influenza, HIV, cancer, and even the SARS-CoV2 Coronavirus.
