In the beginning, there was chemistry. Well, not exactly. From those primordial reaction conditions … life emerged. But how? What separates chemistry from biology? How do we study the origin of life? What can we do with a Chemputer?

In this episode, we’ll head to the lab of Dr. Lee Cronin, Regius Professor of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow, Scotland, and perhaps one of the most provocative chemists in the field today. We'll discuss his lab's view into the origin of life, the balance between theory and reality, and how the Chemputer could be an important component to the future of chemistry.
