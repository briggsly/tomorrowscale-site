### Guest: Melanie Mathue, Ph.D. - Co-founder, CEO - [*Prellis Biologics*](https://prellisbiologics.com)

On this episode, we’ll meet Melanie Matheu, Ph.D., a scientist turning light into life. Her company, Prellis Biologics, has developed what may be a defining technology for the bioprinting industry: A method to print biology on the cellular level. They're shipping printed vasculature and organoids now, and have a plan to be in the clinic with printed organs within 3 years; that's right, some day you might walk around with a Prellis Biologics bioprinted organ inside you. Another interesting startup with huge potential. This is the TomorrowScale Podcast. Hosted by Justin Briggs.
