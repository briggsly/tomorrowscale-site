## Guests: Dr. Alex Zhavoronkov, Co-founder & CEO - InSilico Medicine

Drug discovery is changing. Deep generative models, as being pioneered by our guest Dr. Alex Zhavoronkov, founder and CEO of InSilico Medicine, are able to generate entirely new molecules and even, as we’ll hear, can discover new targets altogether. Within days.

This fall, InSilico and collaborators published an application of their generative reinforcement learning (GENTRL) to generate tens of thousands of novel compounds, synthesized only the 6 best, and identified a selective and nanomolar-potent candidate among them. We discuss deep generative drug discovery models, promise and criticism on these new methodologies, and dive into new research from their pending publications on NASH and we hear about a breaking new contribution by the InSilico team regarding a potential treatment for CoronaVirus. This is the TomorrowScale Podcast. I’m Justin Briggs.
