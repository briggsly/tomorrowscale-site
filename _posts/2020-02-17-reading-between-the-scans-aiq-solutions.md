The ability to visualize disease is vital to many parts of patient care. On this episode, we’ll meet AIQ Solutions, a company that is taking a long-term view of a patient’s response to cancer treatment using computer vision and artificial intelligence. In doing so, they might change not just how we visualize cancer, but how we treat cancer.

Our guest is a former GE executive turned entrepreneur Eric Horler, the CEO of AIQ Solutions, based in Madison, Wisconsin. This is the TomorrowScale podcast, hosted by Justin Briggs.
