## "Serial Entrepreneurship" 
### Guest: Mike Moradi, CEO [*Sensulin*](https://www.sensulin.com/)

What is the difference between an entrepreneur and a serial entrepreneur? Is there a difference? We dig into this question with a four-time hard tech entrepreneur. Mike Moradi is the co-founder and CEO of Sensulin, a company marrying nanotechnology with biotechnology to develop a novel treatment for diabetes that releases insulin on when a patient has high blood sugar.  Mike has founded or helped establish more than a dozen nanotechnology and biotechnology companies, and was selected as a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum.
