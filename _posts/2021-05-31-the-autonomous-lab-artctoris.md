On this episode we'll meet Thomas Fleming, Oxford-trained engineer, and co-founder and Chief Operating Officer of Arctoris a company that has developed a fully-autonomous drug discovery laboratory. 

Founded in Oxford in 2016, Arctoris has staked their claim as the world’s first fully automated drug discovery platform. As the industry automates portions of the R&D pipeline, it will accelerate the development of novel medicines. Thomas and the team at Arctoris are working to accelerate that future. 

This is the TomorrowScale podcast. Hosted by Justin Briggs.
