<p>On this episode we’ll meet Dr. Daniel Levner, co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at <a href="https://emulatebio.com">Emulate</a>, a company commercializing technology to remake human biology from the ground up using small rubbery microfluidic chips.</p>

<p>Forged in a multi-year partnership between &lt; href=”https://www.darpa.mil/” target=”_blank”&gt;<a href="https://www.darpa.mil/">DARPA</a> and Harvard’s <a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/">Wyss Institute</a> for Biologically Inspired Engineering, Emulate develops organ chips for the lung, intestine, liver, kidney, and even the brain. Slotting in between cell culture dishes, organoids, and animal models, this burgeoning area is one in which startups must marry high design and fundamentally challenging biomedical engineering to recapitulate a human being on a chip reproducibly, at scale, and under budget. Their challenge, to simultaneously accelerate and improve outcomes while reducing costs in drug development, is immense. In response, Emulate’s organ chips are elegantly engineered <a href="https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/organs-on-chips-acquired-by-moma/">works of art</a> that could enable scientists to move beyond the dish and blur the lines between <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em>.</p>
