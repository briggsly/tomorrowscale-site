<p>How do you make a molecule? We‚Äôve talked before on the TomorrowScale podcast about the challenges facing chemists‚Äìthe ‚Äúsynthesis barrier.‚Äù The creation of novel materials and the discovery of small molecule drugs is a labor-intensive, iterative process. Exploring new chemical space requires chemistry know-how, ingenuity, and brute force experimentation. It was thought that the chemical space is too vast, and the problem too multifactorial for machine learning to make much headway to unlock nature‚Äôs recipe book.</p>

<p><em>And then, suddenly, it wasn‚Äôt.</em></p>

<p><strong>PostEra uses machine learning to power a Chemistry-as-a-Service offering that hopes to accelerate drug discovery.</strong></p>

<p>On this episode we‚Äôll meet Dr. Alpha Lee, Chief Scientific Officer, and Aaron Martin, CEO, two of three founders of PostEra.  We discuss their work developing novel machine learning models that have demonstrated significant step-change improvements in the state of the art on chemistry-related and binding prediction data science tasks. Dr. Lee‚Äôs research, starting from his lab at the University of Cambridge, includes a model that ‚Äúspeaks chemistry‚Äù [1], a graph neural network model that handles uncertainty in low data environments [2], and another that leverages the statistics of random matrices to tease the signal from the noise [3].</p>

<p><strong>What is the future of chemistry?</strong></p>

He became skeptical concerning the uniqueness of the coordination between keys and doors.‚Äù</strong> - Eugene Wigner, ‚Äú<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/cpa.3160130102">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences</a>‚Äù (1960)</p>
