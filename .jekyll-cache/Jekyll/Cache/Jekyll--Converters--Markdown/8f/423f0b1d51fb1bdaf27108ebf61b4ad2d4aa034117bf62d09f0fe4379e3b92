<p>On this episode we‚Äôll meet biophysicist, machine learning researcher, and CEO of UnlearnAI Dr. Charles Fisher. He and the team at Unlearn have the goal to build the entire biomedical machine learning stack, from scratch. Their strategy is that with a fit-for-purpose biomedical machine learning infrastructure and novel deep learning techniques, along with enough data about patients, that they can generate synthetic versions of actual patients, entirely in the data, with the goal to make them ‚Äúcomputationally indistinguishable‚Äù from real patients.</p>

<p>A ‚Äúdigital twin‚Äù could help to better understand the impact of medicines before they‚Äôre used in a real patient, or in clinical trials to be used alongside real patients in what they call ‚Äúintelligent control arms.‚Äù Unlearn believes that we can obtain the same rigorous, statistically-powered clinical evidence but with fewer subjects. A fascinating approach to the problem of how to make clinical trials more efficient, and understand more about what may be possible with more and better patient data.</p>
