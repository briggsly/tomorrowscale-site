        <title>Nature's Nuclear - Oklo, Inc.</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/tomorrowscale/embed/episodes/Natures-Nuclear---Oklo-Inc-efad3j&quot; height=&quot;102px&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this episode Oklo co-founders Jacob DeWitte and Caroline Cochran join us to discuss what it took to get their startup to this point in development of the first advanced nuclear fission power plant; how a chance meeting with Sam Altman (OpenAI, YCombinator) changed their path; and how to think big, by starting small, even in nuclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year Oklo became the first company to submit a combined construction and operating license application to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (or NRC) for what is called an “advanced fission power plant.” Their design, the Aurora “powerhouse” centers around the concept not of a traditional reactor, but of a small, modular fission battery hundreds of times smaller than traditional reactors. Listen as Jake and Caroline take us through the fascinating founding story of Oklo and their big vision for the small future of clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;guests-dr-ana-jaklenec-mit-langer-lab--dr-kevin-mchugh-rice-university&quot;&gt;Guests: Dr. Ana Jaklenec, MIT Langer Lab &amp;amp; Dr. Kevin McHugh, Rice University&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/tomorrowscale/embed/episodes/Proof-of-Prophylaxis---MIT-Langer-Lab---Drs--Ana-Jaklenec--Kevin-McHugh-e9vbp1&quot; height=&quot;102px&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccines save lives. Yet, despite concerted global efforts more than 1.5 million children die each year from vaccine preventable diseases. The Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation are at the center of this massive endeavor, and have enlisted labs around the world to help solve intractable problems in the developing world, including work recently published in Science Translational Medicine. The technology involves a microneedle patch that can administer a standard vaccine, painlessly, but also leave an invisible vaccination record right on the skin. Meaning those who need vaccines can get them, even in the most remote locations, and those who don’t need them, can prove they are protected without the need for paper or even digital records. You could carry the proof of prophylaxis with you, invisibly, as long as the vaccine protects you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this episode, we’ll meet two of the paper’s co-authors out of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://langerlab.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;Langer Lab at MIT&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-jaklenec-a6526253/&quot;&gt;Dr. Ana Jaklenec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bioengineering.rice.edu/people/faculty/kevin-mchugh&quot;&gt;Dr. Kevin McHugh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://anchor.fm/tomorrowscale/embed/episodes/Proof-of-Prophylaxis---MIT-Langer-Lab---Drs--Ana-Jaklenec--Kevin-McHugh-e9vbp1&quot; height=&quot;102px&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccines save lives. Yet, despite concerted global efforts more than 1.5 million children die each year from vaccine preventable diseases. The Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation are at the center of this massive endeavor, and have enlisted labs around the world to help solve intractable problems in the developing world, including work recently published in Science Translational Medicine. The technology involves a microneedle patch that can administer a standard vaccine, painlessly, but also leave an invisible vaccination record right on the skin. Meaning those who need vaccines can get them, even in the most remote locations, and those who don’t need them, can prove they are protected without the need for paper or even digital records. You could carry the proof of prophylaxis with you, invisibly, as long as the vaccine protects you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this episode, we’ll meet two of the paper’s co-authors out of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://langerlab.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;Langer Lab at MIT&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-jaklenec-a6526253/&quot;&gt;Dr. Ana Jaklenec&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bioengineering.rice.edu/people/faculty/kevin-mchugh&quot;&gt;Dr. Kevin McHugh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
