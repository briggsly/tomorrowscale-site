This year Oklo became the first company to submit a combined construction and operating license application to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (or NRC) for what is called an “advanced fission power plant. ” Their design, the Aurora “powerhouse” centers around the concept not of a traditional reactor, but of a small, modular fission battery hundreds of times smaller than traditional reactors. Listen as Jake and Caroline take us through the fascinating founding story of Oklo and their big vision for the small future of clean energy. This is the TomorrowScale Podcast.

The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation are at the center of this massive endeavor, and have enlisted labs around the world to help solve intractable problems in the developing world, including work recently published in Science Translational Medicine. The technology involves a microneedle patch that can administer a standard vaccine, painlessly, but also leave an invisible vaccination record right on the skin.

Yet, despite concerted global efforts more than 1. 5 million children die each year from vaccine preventable diseases. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation are at the center of this massive endeavor, and have enlisted labs around the world to help solve intractable problems in the developing world, including work recently published in Science Translational Medicine. The technology involves a microneedle patch that can administer a standard vaccine, painlessly, but also leave an invisible vaccination record right on the skin. Meaning those who need vaccines can get them, even in the most remote locations, and those who don’t need them, can prove they are protected without the need for paper or even digital records. You could carry the proof of prophylaxis with you, invisibly, as long as the vaccine protects you.

Deep generative models, as being pioneered by our guest Dr. Alex Zhavoronkov, founder and CEO of InSilico Medicine, are able to generate entirely new molecules and even, as we’ll hear, can discover new targets altogether. Within days. This fall, InSilico and collaborators published an application of their generative reinforcement learning (GENTRL) to generate tens of thousands of novel compounds, synthesized only the 6 best, and identified a selective and nanomolar-potent candidate among them. We discuss deep generative drug discovery models, promise and criticism on these new methodologies, and dive into new research from their pending publications on NASH and we hear about a breaking new contribution by the InSilico team regarding a potential treatment for CoronaVirus.

This is the TomorrowScale Podcast. Hosted by Justin Briggs. Lodo Therapeutics is a drug discovery company based in New York City. Founded based on work by Dr. Sean Brady at Rockerfeller University to discover, develop and even produce medicines by exploring the uncultured microbiomes in our environment. Lodo’s platform could potentially unlock therapeutic molecules encoded within the genes of these bacteria by sequencing the microbial DNA. By doing so first, and at massive scale, they’re able to bridge next-generation sequencing with high-throughput screening to discover what they call “genetically encoded small molecule” therapeutics. Armed with hit-producing microbes and mountains of data, they then leverage machine learning and synthetic biology to optimize and even produce these drug candidate compounds rather than relying on traditional synthesis approaches. It’s modern drug discovery and development from the ground up. To guide us through this complex technology stack, we’ll meet two guides. Dr. Steve Colletti spent 24 years building multiple discovery pipelines across Merck, and currently leads R&amp;D at Lodo. Dr. Dale Pfost is a five-time biotechnology CEO and former General Partner at venture firm Advent Life Sciences, who recently joined Lodo Therapeutics as CEO and Chairman.

We will explore cutting edge technologies with huge potential, and go deep to understand how these founders and inventors must chart entirely new territory to bring their technology to market. On the TomorrowScale Podcast, we have discussions on a wide range of scientific frontiers, from life sciences to AI, nanotech and materials, to medicine and the very food we eat. Our goal is to encourage others who work in or support scientific research and the commercialization of new technologies. We’ll chart the landscape of what’s coming next and the implications. We’ll learn - quite literally - how science fiction becomes reality in research &amp; development labs at companies, universities, and non-profit institutions around the world. First episodes recording now. Stay tuned for new episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, SoundCloud, Anchor, Stitcher, and Overcast. Questions? Ideas for episodes? Email us.
