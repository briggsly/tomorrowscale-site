### Why TomorrowScale?

In order to tackle the biggest problems and build the best science-based companies we need to speak to the people doing the work. Stories from the laboratory to the negotiating table, from the scientists and entrepreneurs on the benches and in the trenches of research and development (R&D), and the commercializtion of novel technology. 

I’m a scientist and entrepreneur. I'm here because of a passion for scientific discovery and a desire to learn directly from peers and leaders regardless of geography.

These are conversations at the cutting edge.

### TomorrowScale's Host: Justin Briggs

Justin Briggs is the host of the TomorrowScale Podcast. Justin is a biotechnology executive and deep technology entrepreneur who works at the nexus of chemistry, biology, and engineering.

Currently, Justin serves as Senior Director of Drug Development and Program Management at Tetherex Pharmaceuticals. Tetherex is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing SelK2 (anti-PSGL-1), a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of multiple inflammatory conditions. In April 2018, Tetherex raised $50 million in Series B funding to progress SelK2 through multiple Phase 2 clinical trials.

Justin has been involved as a founder, investor, advisor, or team member for more than a dozen biotech, nanotech, robotics, and software companies, and gained experience across a wide range of development and commercialization activities relevant to early-stage science-based companies. Justin advises deep technology companies with difficult product development or regulatory challenges at his firm BriggsBio.

Previously, Justin worked on “both sides of the table” at a biotech venture accelerator and venture capital fund, serving as Vice President of Business Development and Operations at Accele BioPharma and Venture Associate at Accele Venture Partners. Accele identified, funded, and managed novel therapeutic and diagnostic startups, including programs to regenerate beta cells in the pancreas for diabetes, neuronal and cell regeneration in hearing loss, fully human antibody discovery for cancer and infectious diseases, and antibiotics discovery tackling multi-drug resistant organisms. Justin also founded SnapLap Technologies (machine vision AI for energy exploration) and Chorus Labs (productivity software, acquired), and is an inventor and author on multiple patents and peer-reviewed publications.

In 2019, based on a passion for difficult scientific problems and the companies that tackle them, Justin created TomorrowScale. The TomorrowScale podcast is a series of conversations with the scientists and entrepreneurs who are building the future.
